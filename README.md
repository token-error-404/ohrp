# FiveM-Server-Status-Bot
Simple live status bot that displays server info.

This was written by Grav using existing modules within discord.js.


This bot is very easy to use and only requires one main module.

This module is `gamedig` and to install, open up your terminal for your bot and type: `npm i gamedig`

If you have any issues or need support, please use `https://discord.gg/ZYHxxba`.
It is optional if you want to add additional fields for logos or server branding but i kept it down to a minimilastic feel for this demo.


`SETUP:`

1) Download the zip and extract.

2) Put your server ip & port into the section that i have marked inside `index.js`

3) Fill in the labeled fields of the server id, channel id & message id.

**THE BOT WILL NOW BE OPERATIONAL**

`Optional Tasks:`

1) Change the embed name & color to fit your server.

`Additional:`

If you know what you are doing, you can just use the index.js and put it inside an existing bot that you have made and then just install the required modules.

`Note:`

I know there is a few modules in `node_modules` that are not needed but i am very lazy so remove them if you know what you are doing xd
